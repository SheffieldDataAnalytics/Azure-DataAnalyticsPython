The units here are unimportant (but each unit might correspond to 1000km, perhaps). The asteroid's velocity is (4.9; -7.1), given as *units per hour*, with separate components for *$x$* and *$y$* directions, i.e. it is moving at 4.9 units per hour in the *$x$* direction, and at -7.1 units per hour in the *$y$* direction.\n",
